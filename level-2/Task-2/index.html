                    <p class="para1">Sundar Pichai is the current CEO of Google and Alphabet. Known as a successful innovator, he focuses
                       
                     on developing new products and services at Google.</p>
                        <h1 class="header2"> Gaining Experience</h1>
                        <p class="para2">In 1997, Sundar Pichai abandoned the Ph.D. program at Stanford University, accepting his master's
                            degree in material sciences and engineering. He joined Allied Materials, a semiconductor
                            manufacturer in Silicon Valley, as a product manager before leaving to pursue an MBA at the
                            University of Pennsylvania. After graduation in 2002, Pichai accepted a position as a management
                            consultant at McKinsey & Co. Having roles of both product manager and consultant at two leading
                            firms, which require product strategy, execution, and team building, prepared Sundar Pichai for his
                            new position at Google in 2004.</p>

                    <h1 class="header3">Success at Google</h1>

                    <p class="para3">Sundar Pichai's interview at Google coincidently coincided with the launch of Google Gmail. Unaware
                        of the new product, Pichai admitted his ignorance during his interviews and is remembered as the
                        candidate with "intellectual humility," which Laszlo Bock, Google’s former senior VP of people
                        operations, called one of the top qualities he looked for in candidates at Google. Pichai was
                        well-prepared but managed a dynamic situation with candor during a moment of uncertainty.1
    
                        On April 1, 2004, Sundar Pichai joined Google as its vice-president of product management and was
                        tasked with the development of Google Toolbar and Google Chrome, which grew to become the world’s
                        most popular internet browser.
                        Pichai launched the Chrome OS and Chromebook in 2011, headed the Android operating system in 2013,
                        and became the leader of all products and engineering at Google by 2014. Pichai oversaw all of
                        Google’s products and platforms, including Search, Maps, Play, Android, Chrome, Gmail, and Google
                        Workspace.
    
                        Tech industry gossip placed Pichai in serious contention for CEO of Microsoft, a position that
                        eventually went to Satya Nadella.3 When Google reorganized into Alphabet in August 2015, Sundar
                        Pichai was selected as Google’s CEO. He joined the board of directors of Alphabet in July 2017.
    
                        Under Pichai's leadership, Google invested in new opportunities such as Google Cloud and YouTube and
                        continues to research advanced technologies, including machine learning and quantum computing.
